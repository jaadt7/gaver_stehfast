# Catalogue of Poisson distributions and their inverse Laplace transform
A jupyter notebook that derives and demonstrates the applicability extent of the Gaver-Stehfest method in calculating the inverse Laplace Transforms. The notebook itself can be found [here](https://github.com/jaadt7/gaver_stehfast/blob/main/gaver_stehfest.ipynb). To be able to test modifications for yourself online, you can open it in google colab by clicking here [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jaadt7/gaver_stehfast/blob/main/gaver_stehfest.ipynb)
